# MIDAS-Submission

Repository containing the code for he solution to the task given by MIDAS-IIITD.


This includes the submission for two problems:
- Python Problem
- Computer Vision Problem

## Python Problem
Includes the code in a Jupyter notebook as well as sample output in CSV format.

## CV Problem
Includes the code in a Jupyter notebook as well as the predictions on the test set in a CSV file.

My solution shows the entire process I took to analzye and solve the problem, the model I used as well as my results and other statistics.

**Note:** The notebooks were run on [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com/) and so the libraries have been imported with that in mind. Also many libraries were already installed in the Colab environment.
